## PROJECT GOALS:
- I want to make an reliable Extruder which is driven with an Worm Gear.
- Pretty much to get an Extruder which can probably compete with the allready supported ones inside the Archetype System.

## Printed parts guide
- Recommended print settings: 4 walls, 40% infill (or more), 0.2mm layer height, 0.4mm nozzle
- Recommended material: **ABS or better**
- Make sure to use Supports! *I would not recommend Organic or Tree Supports*
