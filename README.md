# PROJECT GOALS:
- I want to make an reliable Extruder which is driven with an Worm Gear.
- Pretty much to get an Extruder which can probably compete with the existing ones inside the Archetype System.
- Making an Extruder which doesn`t Suck
- Making an Extruder which realy works
- Spend a shit ton of time for something which other people allready figured out but yeah
- I hate my life enough to make that stuff

# Known Problems
- What? There are no problems. Never. Realy. Just a few.
